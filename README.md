# What Will You Risk?

Just a fun game I made when I was bored. Not really designed to show off any particular skill. However, it is built with Vite, React, Typescript and Tailwind. I also produced the music.

## How to Play

This is completely a game of chance and risk taking. Each round you get to pick from cards ranging from just two to twenty. Each card has a random value in a certain window based on the difficulty level. It could also have one of several possible bombs. Clicking a bomb ends your game and you get to keep 50% of your current score. If you click a value, you get those points added to your current score (also, if there was a "Bonus", your score is multiplied by the bonus).

As the rounds continue to get increasingly more risky, the point values and bonuses go up, but your chance of surival goes down. After each round, you get to choose whether to "Cash Out" (essentially, end the game now and keep your current score) or play on, where you could lose half of everything.

There are a total of 30 rounds.

## Scoring

At the end of the game your score is saved to local storage alongside the other top ten scores (assuming your score was in the top ten).
